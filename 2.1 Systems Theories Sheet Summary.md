I decided to choose the Snowden case. I based my ethical quandaries around the issues present on the sides of both the NSA and Snowden.
My first quandary was the issue of the widespread data collection by the NSA for security reasons. The systems I said this affected were U.S Citizens, National Security, and U.S Intelligence: U.S Citizens because it is their personal data being collected, National Security as the increased surveilance was being used to monitor potential threats, and U.S Intelligence as it was directly gaining more information.
My second quandary was the theft of government information and documents by Snowden to expose it to the public. It affected U.S Citizens as they were informed of the surveillance, the NSA Computer Systems as Snowden exploited them to download top secret information, National Security as the surveillance being halted decreased the ability to monitor potential threats, U.S Intelligence as it was almost impossible to truly determine how much information Snowden stole, and Top Secret Documents as they were stolen by Snowden.
My final quandary was Snowden fleeing the country to Russia with highly classified government information. It affected National Security as a fugitive had escaped the country with classified information, Foreign Influence as Snowden brought top secret government documents into a hostile foreign power like Russia, and Top Secret Documents as they were released by Snowden in Russia.
